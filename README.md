# Space-Invaders-game
A basic one-player game created using Pygame package of Python.
The player in this game is a spaceship, on a mission to shoot down evil aliens.
It is placed at the bottom middle of the screen.
The player is in the form of a spaceship icon, which has freedom to move left and right horizontally, with the help of the left and right arrow keys.
The player has unlimited ammunition, using which, it can shoot down enemies. The player can shoot by pressing the spacebar.
The aliens,(six of them at every instance in the game) appear at random positions at the top area of the game window. 
They move horizontally to the end of the screen, and then drop down a few unit pixels, and resume moving horizontally in the other direction.
The score of the player is displayed at the top left corner of the game window.
Every time the player successfully shoots an alien, the the score gets incremented by one.
If any of the aliens are shot, then they automatically respawn at the top area of the game window and resume their movements.
If the aliens eventually get to the player, then the player dies and hence the game gets over (And the score gets set to zero).
To restart the game, simply click on any key in the keyboard.
The objective of the game is for the player to kill as many aliens as possible and hence attain the highest score possible before getting killed themself.
